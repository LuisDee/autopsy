# Execution Sequence

> Wave-based ordering derived from the dependency graph.
> Generated by: `python scripts/topological_sort.py`
> Tracks within the same wave are independent and can run in parallel.
> All tracks in a wave must complete before the next wave starts.

## Wave 1 — Foundation

| # | Track ID | Complexity | Description |
|---|----------|------------|-------------|
| 01 | 01_plugin_scaffold | S | Plugin manifest, directory structure, README |

### Wave 1 Completion Criteria
- [ ] All phases in all wave tracks marked complete
- [ ] `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` is valid JSON
- [ ] Directory structure matches spec: `commands/`, `agents/`, `skills/codebase-documentation/`
- [ ] `README.md` covers installation, commands, architecture
- [ ] `find deep-review/ -type f | sort` shows correct structure

## Wave 2 — Agents

| # | Track ID | Complexity | Description |
|---|----------|------------|-------------|
| 02 | 02_discovery_agent | M | Phase 1 agent: repo mapping, AGENTS.md generation, batch planning |
| 03 | 03_review_agents | L | Phase 2 agents: bug-hunter, security-auditor, error-inspector, performance-detector, stack-reviewer |
| 04 | 04_synthesizer_agent | M | Phase 3 agent: dedup, cross-cutting analysis, REVIEW_REPORT.md |

### Wave 2 Completion Criteria
- [ ] All phases in all wave tracks marked complete
- [ ] All 7 agent definition files exist in `agents/`
- [ ] Each agent has YAML frontmatter with name, description, tools
- [ ] Each review agent includes 2-3 few-shot finding examples
- [ ] Each agent includes self-review step
- [ ] All agents follow the standardized finding format
- [ ] Exhaustive checklists are complete (not abbreviated)

## Wave 3 — Commands & Integration

| # | Track ID | Complexity | Description |
|---|----------|------------|-------------|
| 05 | 05_orchestrator_command | XL | Main orchestrator: 3-phase coordination, batch management, context pressure handling |
| 06 | 06_secondary_commands | M | maintain-docs command, codebase-documentation passive skill |

### Wave 3 Completion Criteria
- [ ] All phases in all wave tracks marked complete
- [ ] `commands/full-review.md` correctly references all 7 agents
- [ ] Orchestrator includes compaction-safe state management
- [ ] Batch sizing strategy implemented (small/medium/large/huge repos)
- [ ] Progress tracking writes to both `state.json` and `progress.md`
- [ ] `commands/maintain-docs.md` detects git changes and updates AGENTS.md files
- [ ] `skills/codebase-documentation/SKILL.md` has correct YAML frontmatter
- [ ] Passive skill does NOT trigger during deep-review operations
- [ ] Plugin loads successfully: `claude --plugin-dir ./deep-review`
- [ ] `find deep-review/ -type f | sort` shows all 12 files

## Progress Summary

| Wave | Tracks | Total Complexity | Status |
|------|--------|-----------------|--------|
| 1 | 1 | 1 (S) | NOT_STARTED |
| 2 | 3 | 7 (M+L+M) | NOT_STARTED |
| 3 | 2 | 6 (XL+M) | NOT_STARTED |

Overall: 0/14 complexity-weighted units complete (0%)
