# Deep Review: Full Review

You are the orchestrator for a deep, multi-agent code review. You coordinate three phases:
1. **Discovery** — Map the repo, generate documentation, create a batch plan
2. **Review** — Launch 5 specialized agents in parallel per batch
3. **Synthesis** — Deduplicate findings, cross-cut analysis, produce final report

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- You NEVER read source code files directly — only batch plans, progress files, and output existence checks
- All heavy work happens in sub-agents with fresh context windows
- Disk (`.deep-review/` directory) is the coordination layer between phases
- Write state to disk before every batch — this makes the review resumable after compaction

---

## Setup

### Step 1: Initialize

```bash
mkdir -p .deep-review
```

Add `.deep-review/` to `.gitignore` if not already present:

```bash
grep -q '.deep-review/' .gitignore 2>/dev/null || echo '.deep-review/' >> .gitignore
```

### Step 2: Record start time

Write initial state:

```json
{
  "phase": "setup",
  "started_at": "{ISO timestamp}",
  "phase_times": {},
  "batches_total": 0,
  "batches_completed": 0,
  "findings": {"critical": 0, "high": 0, "medium": 0, "low": 0},
  "agent_failures": [],
  "false_positives_removed": 0
}
```

Write this to `.deep-review/state.json`.

### Step 3: Set effort level

Run `/effort max` to ensure maximum reasoning depth for all sub-agents.

---

## Phase 1: Discovery

### Step 4: Launch discovery agent

Update `state.json`: set `"phase": "discovery"`.

Launch the discovery agent using the **Task tool** in FOREGROUND (blocking):

**Prompt for the discovery agent:**
> You are the discovery agent for a deep code review. Your job is to map the entire repository, understand every module, create AGENTS.md documentation files, and produce a batch plan for the review phase.
>
> Follow the instructions in your agent definition file (`agents/discovery.md`) exactly. Complete all 5 steps:
> 1. Map the repository (file inventory, stats, metadata)
> 2. Understand every module (read files, analyze each directory)
> 3. Generate AGENTS.md files (with companion CLAUDE.md) for directories with 3+ code files
> 4. Write the discovery profile to `.deep-review/discovery.md`
> 5. Generate the batch plan to `.deep-review/batch-plan.md`
>
> Run your self-review checklist before completing.

**Agent configuration:**
- `subagent_type`: Use the discovery agent
- Do NOT run in background — wait for completion

### Step 5: Read discovery results

After the discovery agent completes:

1. Check if `.deep-review/discovery.md` exists — if NOT, print "Discovery failed: discovery.md not found. Cannot proceed." and abort.
2. Check if `.deep-review/batch-plan.md` exists — if NOT, print "Discovery failed: batch-plan.md not found. Cannot proceed." and abort.
3. Read `.deep-review/batch-plan.md` to determine:
   - Total number of batches
   - Files per batch
   - Total files to review
4. Read `.deep-review/discovery.md` for repo stats (total files, modules, AGENTS.md count)

Update `state.json`:
- `"phase": "review"`
- `"batches_total": {N}`
- `"phase_times": {"discovery": "{elapsed}"}`

Print:
```
Phase 1 complete. Discovered {N} files across {M} modules.
Created {X} AGENTS.md files. Generated {B} review batches.
Discovery took {time}.
```

### Step 5a: Gather recent changes context

If this is a git repository, capture recent intentional changes:

```bash
git log --oneline -10 2>/dev/null > .deep-review/recent-changes.txt || echo "Not a git repo" > .deep-review/recent-changes.txt
```

This file will be passed to review agents so they don't flag intentional recent changes as bugs.

---

## Phase 2: Review

### Step 6: Process batches sequentially

For each batch in the batch plan (highest risk first):

#### 6a. Create batch directory

```bash
mkdir -p .deep-review/batch-{N}
```

#### 6b. Write state before launching agents

Update `state.json`:
- `"current_batch": {N}`
- Save all current progress

Write `.deep-review/progress.md`:
```markdown
# Review Progress

## Status
- Phase: Review
- Current batch: {N} of {total}
- Batches completed: {list}

## Findings So Far
- 🔴 Critical: {N}
- 🟠 High: {N}
- 🟡 Medium: {N}
- 🔵 Low: {N}

## Agent Failures
{list any failures, or "None"}
```

**This state write is critical — it enables recovery after compaction.**

#### 6c. Launch 5 review agents in PARALLEL (foreground)

Launch all 5 review agents as separate foreground Task calls in a **single response**. Claude Code executes them concurrently when multiple Task calls are made in the same message. Each agent writes its own output file using the Write tool (which is fully available in foreground agents).

For each of the 5 review agents (bug-hunter, security-auditor, error-inspector, performance-detector, stack-reviewer):

**Prompt template for each review agent:**
> You are the {agent-name} agent for a deep code review.
>
> **Your assignment — Batch {N}: {batch descriptive name}**
>
> Review these directories:
> {list of directories from batch plan}
>
> **Instructions:**
> 1. Read the AGENTS.md file in each assigned directory FIRST for module context
> 2. Read the FULL contents of EVERY file in your assigned directories — no skimming
> 3. Check every item in your agent checklist (from your agent definition)
> 4. Write your findings to `.deep-review/batch-{N}/{agent-output-file}.md`
>
> **Output file:** `.deep-review/batch-{N}/{output-name}.md`
>
> **Finding format (STRICT):**
> ```
> ## {SEVERITY_EMOJI} {SEVERITY}: {short description}
> **File:** `{exact/file/path.ext}`
> **Line(s):** {line number or range}
> **Category:** {category}
> **Confidence:** {High|Medium|Low}
> **Description:** {what's wrong}
> **Impact:** {what breaks}
> **Fix:** {specific fix}
> ```
>
> **Severity scale:**
> - 🔴 CRITICAL: Crashes, data loss, security breaches in production
> - 🟠 HIGH: Bugs under common conditions
> - 🟡 MEDIUM: Edge case issues
> - 🔵 LOW: Could lead to future bugs
>
> **Confidence rules:**
> - High: Exact code path shown
> - Medium: Pattern suggests issue, can't fully trace
> - Low: Heuristic/inferred
>
> **Mandatory rules:**
> - Read FULL contents of every file
> - Do NOT say "looks fine" or skip files
> - Every finding needs exact file path and line number
> - Re-read 100+ line files with zero findings
> - Report undocumented gotchas as "Documentation Gap" findings
> - Focus on YOUR domain expertise. If an issue clearly belongs to another agent's domain (e.g., security for bug-hunter), note it briefly as a one-liner but don't write a full finding
> - Read `.deep-review/recent-changes.txt` for context on recent intentional changes. Do not flag recently committed changes as missing features unless there's an actual bug.
>
> Start your output with a header:
> ```
> # {Agent Name} — Batch {N} Findings
> **Files reviewed:** {count}
> **Total findings:** {count}
> **By severity:** 🔴 {n} | 🟠 {n} | 🟡 {n} | 🔵 {n}
> ```
>
> Run your self-review checklist before completing.

**Agent-to-output mapping:**
| Agent | Output File |
|-------|------------|
| bug-hunter | `bugs.md` |
| security-auditor | `security.md` |
| error-inspector | `errors.md` |
| performance-detector | `performance.md` |
| stack-reviewer | `stack.md` |

#### 6d. Verify agent output

After all 5 foreground agents return, verify their output files exist:

```bash
ls .deep-review/batch-{N}/bugs.md .deep-review/batch-{N}/security.md .deep-review/batch-{N}/errors.md .deep-review/batch-{N}/performance.md .deep-review/batch-{N}/stack.md 2>/dev/null | wc -l
```

For any missing file, the agent failed to write its output. Log to `state.json` under `"agent_failures"` and to `progress.md`. Optionally retry ONCE with a refined prompt (add: "Previous attempt failed. Ensure you write output to the specified file path using the Write tool.")

**Do NOT block the entire review on a single agent failure.**

#### 6e. Count findings and update progress

For each completed output file, count findings by severity:

```bash
grep -c '🔴 CRITICAL' .deep-review/batch-{N}/bugs.md 2>/dev/null || echo 0
grep -c '🟠 HIGH' .deep-review/batch-{N}/bugs.md 2>/dev/null || echo 0
# ... for each file and severity
```

Update `state.json` and `progress.md` with running totals.

Print:
```
Batch {N}/{total} complete. Found {X} issues so far.
  🔴 {n} | 🟠 {n} | 🟡 {n} | 🔵 {n}
```

#### 6f. Batch sizing strategy

The discovery agent creates the batch plan, but the orchestrator adapts its processing strategy based on repo size:

| Repo Size | Files | Parallel Batches | Compaction Strategy |
|-----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Small | < 50 | All at once | None needed |
| Medium | 50-200 | 1 batch at a time | Auto-compaction handles it |
| Large | 200-500 | 1 batch at a time | Write state before each batch |
| Huge | 500+ | 1 batch at a time | Write state before each batch; expect auto-compaction between batches |

### Step 7: Phase 2 summary

After all batches complete:

Update `state.json`:
- `"phase": "synthesis"`
- `"phase_times": {..., "review": "{elapsed}"}`

Print:
```
Phase 2 complete. {total findings} issues found across {B} batches.
Review took {time}. {failures} agent failure(s).
```

---

## Phase 3: Synthesis

### Step 8: Launch synthesizer agent

Launch the synthesizer agent using the **Task tool** in FOREGROUND (blocking):

**Prompt for the synthesizer agent:**
> You are the synthesizer for a deep code review. Your job is to read all findings, deduplicate them, spot-check top issues, perform cross-cutting analysis, and produce the final report.
>
> Follow the instructions in your agent definition file (`agents/synthesizer.md`) exactly. Complete all 5 steps:
> 1. Read ALL findings from ALL `.deep-review/batch-*/` directories
> 2. Apply three-level deduplication (exact match, semantic overlap, systemic patterns)
> 3. Spot-check top 10 Critical/High findings by re-reading actual code
> 4. Perform all 4 cross-cutting analyses (architecture, dependencies, testing gaps, secrets)
> 5. Update root AGENTS.md and write REVIEW_REPORT.md to the repo root
>
> **Important:**
> - Elevate confidence for multi-agent consensus — do NOT change severity
> - Include ALL findings (no cap per severity level)
> - Update root AGENTS.md only (not subdirectory files)
>
> Run your self-review checklist before completing.

### Step 9: Verify synthesis output

After the synthesizer completes:

1. Verify `REVIEW_REPORT.md` exists in the repo root
2. If missing, retry synthesizer once
3. If `REVIEW_REPORT.md` still does not exist after retry, create a minimal fallback report:
   - List total files reviewed (from discovery.md)
   - List paths to raw findings: `ls .deep-review/batch-*/*.md`
   - Note: "Synthesis failed. Raw findings are available in the .deep-review/ directory."
   - This preserves the review work instead of losing it entirely.
4. Read the statistics section of REVIEW_REPORT.md for final counts

Update `state.json`:
- `"phase": "complete"`
- `"phase_times": {..., "synthesis": "{elapsed}"}`

Print:
```
Phase 3 complete. REVIEW_REPORT.md generated. Synthesis took {time}.
```

---

## Final Summary

### Step 10: Print completion summary

Read final statistics from `state.json` and REVIEW_REPORT.md. Print:

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════
  DEEP REVIEW COMPLETE
═══════════════════════════════════════════

  Duration:       {total time}
    Discovery:    {phase 1 time}
    Review:       {phase 2 time}
    Synthesis:    {phase 3 time}

  Files reviewed: {count}
  Modules documented: {count} AGENTS.md files

  Findings:
    🔴 Critical:  {N}
    🟠 High:      {N}
    🟡 Medium:    {N}
    🔵 Low:       {N}

  Reports:
    → REVIEW_REPORT.md    (full findings)
    → AGENTS.md files     (persistent documentation)

  Next steps:
    1. Read REVIEW_REPORT.md for prioritized findings
    2. Fix 🔴 Critical issues first
    3. Run /deep-review:maintain-docs after making changes
═══════════════════════════════════════════
```

## Compaction Recovery

If context compaction occurs at any point during the review:

1. **Read state:** `cat .deep-review/state.json`
2. **Read progress:** `cat .deep-review/progress.md`
3. **Read batch plan:** `cat .deep-review/batch-plan.md`
4. **Resume from where you left off:**
   - If `phase` is "discovery": Discovery agent is running or failed — check for output files and proceed to Phase 2 if they exist
   - If `phase` is "review": Check `batches_completed` and `current_batch` — skip completed batches, resume from current
   - If `phase` is "synthesis": Synthesizer is running or failed — check for REVIEW_REPORT.md
   - If `phase` is "complete": Print the final summary

**This recovery logic is the reason we write state to disk before every batch.** Auto-compaction can happen at any time — the review must be resilient to it.

## Error Handling Summary

| Error | Action |
|-------|--------|
| Discovery agent fails | Abort review — cannot proceed without batch plan |
| Review agent output missing | Log failure, retry once, continue if still missing |
| All 5 agents fail for a batch | Log as failed batch, continue to next batch |
| Synthesizer fails | Retry once. If still fails, point user to raw findings in `.deep-review/batch-*/` |
| REVIEW_REPORT.md missing | Retry synthesizer. If still missing, create a minimal report listing raw finding file paths |
| Context compaction | Re-read state.json + progress.md + batch-plan.md, resume |
